Todo List with React

Todo List application in React and Redux, connected to Firebase. Users can create new todo lists or edit their current lists. On the homescreen, the user can logout, enter one of their current todo lists, or create a new list. Once viewing a todo list, the user can sort lists by name, date or status as well as move list items up and down. These changes are also reflected in Firebase. Users can add or delete items in the list and can delete the lists as a whole using the trash can icon.
